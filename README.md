# Dictionary-HTML-CSS-JS--using-API
This was a Youtube tutorial that I followed while adding my touches.
# What Did I learn/practice
The main thing that I learned was to work with APIs in this case the
dictionary API to rethrive the word meaning as well as the audio pronunciation.
I also learned some more DOM manipulation and event listener like keyup.
Besides. I got more practice with the frontend while styling the look of the
website as well as handling error for better user experience.
